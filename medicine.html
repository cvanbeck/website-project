            </div>
            <div class="content-boxes" id="center">
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is slowly but surely becoming
                    an essential part of healthcare. Thanks to AI-powered applications
                    such as deep learning algorithms among other things being used to
                    process medical data, we’re well on our way to providing experts
                    in the field with much-needed perception, and improving patient
                    experiences and overall health results. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-boxes" id="center">
                <p>Presently, only very specific settings in the field of medicine profit from the
                    application of artificial intelligence, for example seizures, hypoglycemia, or the diagnosis of
                    disease
                    based on medical imaging. The pursuance of augmented medicine is highly anticipated by patients
                    because it aims for a greater freedom and a more personalized treatment although it is met with
                    great
                    hostility from specialists which were not ready for such an adaptation of clinical practice.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-boxes" id="center">
                <p>This phenomena also brings about the need to validate these modern equipments with traditional
                    clinical trials, discuss the educational improvement of the medical curriculum because of digital
                    medicine along with ethical consideration of the current connected monitoring.</p>

                <p>Machine Learning has made great advances in pharma and biotech efficiency.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-boxes" id="section-header">Diagnosing Diseases</div>
            <div class="content-boxes" id="center">
                <p>First of all great strides have been made in diagnosing diseases. Accurately diagnosing diseases
                    takes years of medical training. Even then, diagnostics is generally a taxing, time-consuming
                    procedure. In many fields, the demand for professionals far outweighs the accessible supply. This
                    puts physicians under pressure and often delays life-saving patient diagnostics. Machine Learning,
                    particularly Deep Learning algorithms, have lately made huge advances in automatically
                    detecting diseases, making diagnostics cheaper and more accessible.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-boxes" id="center">
                <p>Machine Learning algorithms can master pattern detection similarly to the way doctors see them. A
                    key distinction is that algorithms need a lot of concrete examples in order to learn. And these
                    examples need to be neatly digitized as machines can’t read between the lines in textbooks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-boxes" id="center">
                <p>So Machine Learning is particularly beneficial in areas where the diagnostic information a physician
                    examines is already digitized. For example finding signs of diabetic retinopathy in eye images,
                    categorizing skin lesions in skin images, discovering strokes or lung cancer based on CT scans.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-boxes" id="section-header">Drug Development</div>
            <div class="content-boxes" id="center">
                Secondly Machine Learning is well on its way to develop drugs faster. Developing drugs is an expensive
                process. A lot of the analytical processes involved in drug development can be made more effective with
                Machine Learning. This has the promise of shaving off years of work and hundreds of millions in
                investments. AI has already been used favourably in all of the four main stages in drug development.

                    <li>Third stage: Accelerating clinical trials </li>
                    <li>Fourth stage: Finding Biomarkers for diagnosing the disease</li>

            <div class="content-boxes" id="section-header">Personalised Treatment</div>
            <div class="content-boxes" id="center">
                <p>Thirdly personalizing treatment. Different patients respond to drugs and treatment schedules
                    differently. Therefore personalized treatment has tremendous potential to prolong patients’
                    lifespans. But it’s very difficult to label which components should affect the choice of treatment.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-boxes" id="center">
                <p>Machine Learning can mechanize this complex statistical work and help ascertain which attributes
                    implies that a patient will have a particular response to a particular treatment. So the algorithm
                    can predict a patient’s probable response to a particular treatment. The system figures this out by
                    cross-referencing comparable patients and associates their treatments and outcomes. The resulting
                    outcome predictions makes it easier for physicians to plan out the right treatment program.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-boxes" id="section-header">Gene Editing</div>
            <div class="content-boxes" id="center">
                <p>Fourthly improving gene editing. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR),
                    is a huge step forward in the cability to edit DNA cost effectively and accurately just like a
                    surgeon. This approach depends on short guide RNA (sgRNA) to target and edit a definitive region on
                    the DNA but the guide RNA can fit numerous DNA locations which can result in inadvertent side
                    effects known as off-target effects. The meticulous drafting of guide RNA with the least perilous
                    side effects is a major hindrance in the application of the CRISPR system. Machine Learning models
                    are tried and tested in the provision of the best results when it comes to forecasting the degree of
                    both guide-target interactions and off-target effects for a given sgRNA. This can substantially
                    speed up the augmentation of guide RNA for every region of human DNA.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-boxes" id="center">
                <p>Artificial Intelligence is already aiding us more adequately diagnose diseases, develop drugs,
                    personalize treatments, and even edit genes. But this is only the beginning. The more we computerize
                    and consolidate the medical data available to us, the more we can use AI to help us find beneficial
                    patterns we can use in making detailed, cost-effective outcomes in complex analytical processes.</p>
